## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an **Infrastructure Engineer** by trade, but a well-rounded **developer** at heart. I actively work across a range of languages and technologies including:

* 🟨 **Node.js**
* 🟦 **Go (Golang)**
* 🐍 **Python**

Most of my programming projects support my full-time role in **healthcare IT infrastructure**, where I use code as a tool to **automate**, **simplify**, and **optimize** operational tasks.

I view programming as more than just a skill—it's a force multiplier. Whether it's scripting deployments, building services, or creating tools to help my team, I code to make life easier for myself and the community around me.
